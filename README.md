# Hi there! 👋
I'm Andres Cervantes, a Computer Engineering graduate from the University of California, Irvine.

## About Me 👨‍💻
During my time at UC Irvine, I had some fantastic experiences that helped shape my skills and knowledge. I love diving into the anything tech related. I enjoy tinkering with computer hardware and software but my favorite topics are Machine Learning and app development! 

## Skills 🔨
I'm proficient in Python, C, Java, CSS, HTML, and Javascript. I have worked with Kotlin and RISC-V ISA and feel comfortable enough on my own, but would not say that I am proficient in it. Nonetheless, my current personal projects involve using these languages so I am always learning. My coursework at UC Irvine covered a wide range of topics, including computer networks, system software, object-oriented programming, data management, machine learning, computer architecture, and more.

## Interests 🥤
I love exploring the intersection of technology, problem-solving, and teamwork. In fact, the reason I majored in Computer Engineering is so I can learn just about everything about how a computer works, from the bare metals and circuits to registers and all the way up to high level programming. You can always expect me to keep up with the latest technology-related trends. Right now I am really into the world of autonomy and computational photography. 

Outside of programming you can find me practicing graphic design, cooking, at the beach, or trying to improve my photography. 

## Let's Connect! 🤝
If you're interested in collaborating or have any questions, feel free to reach out! You can connect with me on LinkedIn or on email!

Looking forward to connecting with fellow tech enthusiasts! 🚀
