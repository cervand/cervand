# Hi there! 👋
I'm Andres Cervantes, a Computer Engineering graduate from the University of California, Irvine.

## About Me 👨‍💻
I love diving into the anything tech related. I enjoy tinkering with computer hardware and software but my favorite topics are Machine Learning and app development! During my time at UC Irvine, I had some fantastic experiences that helped shape my skills and knowledge.

## Skills & Interests 🏓
I'm proficient in Python, C, Java. I have worked with Kotlin, CSS, HTML, SQL, RISC-V ISA, and Javascript and feel comfortable enough on my own, but would not say that I am proficient in it. Nonetheless, my current personal projects involve using these languages so I am always learning. My coursework at UC Irvine covered a wide range of topics, including computer networks, system software, object-oriented programming, data management, machine learning, computer architecture, and more.

I love exploring the intersection of technology, problem-solving, and teamwork. I'm passionate about machine learning, concurrent programming, AWS, embedded systems, and Linux.

Outside of programming, I love photography and cooking!
